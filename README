Quill
=====

Quill is a REPL skeleton. All you need to do is write the commands you'd like
to support in the form of methods in a module.


Running me
----------

Hopefully you have RVM and Bundler installed. I've not tested running
without it, but it should work at least for ree-1.8.7-2010.02 if you have all
the necessary gems installed (check the Gemfile, YMMV).

    cd path/to/quill
    bin/quill.sh

That's it, you're running Quill. Type `help` for some instructions.


Writing your own language
-------------------------

The whole point of Quill was to let you easily support the language you
wanted. How do you do that? Simple, create a class that exposes the language
then tell Quill to support it.

A language is just a plain Ruby class, something like this:

    class Sysadmin
      def uptime
        puts %x[uptime].strip
      end

      def whoami
        puts %x[whoami].strip
      end

      def run command_line
        puts %x[#{command_line}].strip
      end
    end

To tell Quill to support your language just pass it at the command line:

    ./bin/quill.sh --language Sysadmin

Quill will search for your language in the LOAD_PATH in a file based on your
language name. The sysadmin language shown above should be in the LOAD_PATH in
a file called sysadmin.rb
