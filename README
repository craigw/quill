Quill
=====

Quill is a REPL skeleton. All you need to do is write the commands you'd like to
support in the form of methods in a module.

Running me
----------

Hopefully you have RVM and Bundler installed. I've not tested running
without it, but it should work at least for ree-1.8.7-2010.02 if you have all
the necessary gems installed (check the Gemfile, YMMV).

    cd path/to/quill
    bin/quill.sh

That's it, you're running Quill. Type `help` for some instructions.
